bbdoc: Cipher Block Chaining Mode
about: A simple mode designed to prevent trivial forms of replay and swap attacks on ciphers.

It is important that the initialization vector be unique and preferably random for each message encrypted under the same key.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Initializes the chaining mode state as if the original IV were the new IV specified.
	about: The @length of @IV must be the size of the cipher block size.
	
	This method is handy if you wish to change the IV without reâ€“keying the cipher.

	The new IV replaces the existing IV as if it were the last ciphertext block.
